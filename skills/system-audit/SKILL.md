# Maintenance Sweep

> System-wide health check using agnix lint + 7 parallel sub-agents. Produces a consolidated report at `audits/system-audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md`. **Report-only — never modifies any files.**

## When to Use

- Periodic system hygiene (monthly or after major changes)
- When the user says "maintenance sweep", "system health check", "audit my setup"
- After adding/removing skills, hooks, agents, or rules
- Before presenting the system to others (ensure everything is consistent)

## Overview

1. **Lint** — run `npx agnix .` to validate skills, hooks, agents, and CLAUDE.md
2. **Dispatch** — launch 7 sub-agents in parallel via the Task tool
3. **Collect** — gather each sub-agent's findings
4. **Consolidate** — merge lint results + sub-agent findings into a single timestamped report
5. **Present** — show key findings to the user

**Python:** Always use `uv run python` or `uv pip install`. Never bare `python`, `python3`, `pip`, or `pip3`. Include this in sub-agent prompts.

---

## Phase 0: agnix Lint

Run `npx agnix .` in the main context (no sub-agent needed — it's fast). Capture the summary line.

**Pass criteria:** 0 errors. Warnings are informational only.

If errors > 0, list them in the report under an **agnix Lint** section. These are structural issues in skill/hook/agent frontmatter that should be fixed.

Config lives in `.agnix.toml` at project root — known false positives are already suppressed.

---

## Phase 1: Dispatch Sub-Agents

Launch all 7 in a single message using parallel Task tool calls. Each sub-agent is `subagent_type: Explore`.

**Context overflow prevention:** Instruct each sub-agent to keep its returned output concise — summary tables and key findings only (under 500 words). If detailed findings are large, the sub-agent should write them to a temp file (e.g., `/tmp/system-audit/sa-N.md`) and return only the file path + summary.

All sub-agents receive shared context (workspace root, research projects root, category directories). Full shared context block and all 6 sub-agent prompt templates:

**[references/sub-agent-prompts.md](references/sub-agent-prompts.md)**

Sub-agents at a glance:

| # | Name | What it checks |
|---|------|---------------|
| 1 | Inventory Auditor | Skill/hook/agent/rule counts, symlinks, MCP alignment |
| 2 | Bibliography & Project Hygiene | .bib files, naming, MEMORY.md presence |
| 3 | Convention Compliance | LaTeX out/, Overleaf separation, Python env, git health |
| 4 | Documentation Freshness | Stale counts, broken links, .context/ freshness |
| 5 | Ecosystem Health | MCP server refs, staleness, orphans, CLI tools |
| 6 | Skill Quality & Overlap | Bloat, staleness, cross-component overlap |
| 7 | Santi Repo Health | Skill/rule freshness vs upstream, anonymisation, install script |

---

## Phase 2: Collect and Consolidate

After all 7 sub-agents return, merge their findings into a single report.

### Report Template

Write to `audits/system-audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown
# Maintenance Sweep — YYYY-MM-DD

## Dashboard

## Phase 3: Present

Show the user:
1. The dashboard table
2. Any FAIL-status areas with specifics
3. The quick fixes list
4. Ask if he wants to address any issues now

## Error Handling

- **Sub-agent timeout:** If a sub-agent doesn't return, note "timed out" in the report and continue with the others.
- **Missing directories:** If a category folder is empty or doesn't exist, note "no projects found" rather than erroring.
- **Permission issues:** If files can't be read, note "access denied" and continue.

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| `/bib-validate` | Run on projects flagged by the Bibliography Hygiene sub-agent |
| `/audit-project-research` | Complements Convention Compliance with deeper per-project checks |
| `/update-project-doc` | Fix documentation staleness found by Documentation Freshness |
| `/sync-permissions` | Fix symlink issues found by Inventory Auditor |
| `/insights-deck` | Maintenance findings can feed into system insights presentations |
| `/audit-doc santi` | Dedicated deep audit for santi-repo — Sub-agent 7 is a quick health check; the audit skill is the full version |
| `/sync-santi-repo` | Fix freshness issues found by Sub-agent 7 |
